SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
  -ARDUINO IDE SOFTWARE
  -MQTT IOT Panel app


We used the [MQTT IoT Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel.prod&hl=en-US) Android app to visualize and control our smart home system.

**Features:**
- Real-time sensor monitoring (temperature, gas levels)
- Remote control of appliances via MQTT
- Customizable UI with buttons, sliders, graphs
- Secure communication using SSL
- Works with public MQTT brokers

**Setup:**
1. Download the app from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel.prod&hl=en-US)
2. Configure MQTT broker settings (host, port, username/password)
3. Create panels for each sensor or actuator
4. Subscribe/publish to relevant MQTT topics used in the NodeMCU code
